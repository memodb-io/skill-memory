- Always plan a markdown at dev_plans/ before you code
- A dev plan should at least contain `features`, `overall designs`, `implementation TODOS`, `impact files`, `new deps`, `test cases` sections
- Remember to update the related dev plans after you finish your work.
- Once you finished a dev plan, always report to me to make sure you're doing it right. If I approve your code, move the dev plan .md to ./dev_plans/done to archive it.
